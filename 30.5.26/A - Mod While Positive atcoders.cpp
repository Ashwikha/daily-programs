/*
You are given positive integers 
N and 
M.

If the following operation is repeated while the value of 
M is not 
0, find the number of operations performed.

Let 
x be the remainder when 
N is divided by 
M. Replace the value of 
M with 
x.
It can be proved that 
M becomes 
0 after a finite number of operations.

Constraints
1≤N,M≤1000
All input values are integers.
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N 
M
Output
Output the answer.

Sample Input 1
Copy
8 5
Sample Output 1
Copy
3
Initially, 
N=8 and 
M=5.

The remainder when 
8 is divided by 
5 is 
3, so 
M=3 after one operation.

The remainder when 
8 is divided by 
3 is 
2, so 
M=2 after two operations.

The remainder when 
8 is divided by 
2 is 
0, so 
M=0 after three operations.

Thus, output 
3 as the answer.

Sample Input 2
Copy
14 6
Sample Output 2
Copy
2
Sample Input 3
Copy
460 33
Sample Output 3
Copy
5
